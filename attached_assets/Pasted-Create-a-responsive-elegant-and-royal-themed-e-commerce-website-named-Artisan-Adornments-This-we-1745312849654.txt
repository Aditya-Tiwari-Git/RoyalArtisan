Create a responsive, elegant, and royal-themed e-commerce website named Artisan Adornments.

This website should load product data dynamically from the following Google Sheet (public):
üìÑ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQFhHfbv7t0feGMlihnnHT8qiIkcHJEk3RIq3i3yPJ0/edit?usp=sharing

‚úÖ Features Required:
Display products in grid cards using the sheet data:

Show: Name, Image, Description, Price, Offer (if available), and "Out of Stock" if IsAvailable = No.

Add a Buy on WhatsApp button for each product:

On click, it should redirect to WhatsApp (https://wa.me/918619999198) with the message from the WhatsAppMessage column.

Add category filters at the top (like Saree, Jewellery, God Veshbusha, Spiritual Cloth) based on the Category column.

Add a search bar to search by name or tags.

Highlight products with Featured = Yes in a Featured Items section at the top.

Ensure products are sorted by DisplayOrder column (if present).

Use a floating WhatsApp icon for instant support on all pages.

üé® Design Instructions:
Overall vibe: Premium, Spiritual, Classical, Royal

Fonts: Use serif or devotional fonts for headings, and clean sans-serif for text.

Color Palette:

Maroon #800000

Soft Gold #D4AF37

Off-white #F9F5F0

Royal Blue #002366

Include graceful animations on hover, soft shadows, and large rounded corners.

Responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

üìå Technical Notes:
The Google Sheet should be parsed using Tabletop.js or Google Visualization API to get real-time data.

Use pure HTML/CSS/JS (or React if supported).

The ImageURL column provides direct image links.

Offer text should appear as a badge (e.g., ‚Äú10% OFF‚Äù).

If IsAvailable = No, disable the Buy button and overlay ‚ÄúOut of Stock‚Äù.

Optional:

Add an Instagram feed section at the bottom (placeholder for now).

Add a contact section with email form and WhatsApp chat.
